      <p>
        Welcome to my little corner of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a web developer living in Colorado, and the intent of this site will be to
        host a few projects I am working on.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of this writing (4/11) I only just started this site a few days ago, so there is not much yet to show...
        but check back as I will be working on it throughout the month of April.
