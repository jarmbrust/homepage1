        Welcome to my little corner of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is pretty bare-bones at the moment. I started playing around with making it in early April 2018, and hope
        to have it more or less fleshed out by the end of the month.  Currently I have a few misc code samples and pictures
        of my dogs.  But as they say, you have to start somewhere!
