      <p>
        Welcome to my little corner of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is pretty bare-bones at the moment. I started playing around with making it 4/6/2018 and hope
        to have it more or less fleshed out by the end of April.  Right now I am using it to host a few
        peices of code I wrote and projects I am working on, and to of course show off pictures of my dogs.
