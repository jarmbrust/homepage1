      Originally from Minneapolis I moved to sunny Colorado around nine years ago with my wife Lacey where
      we bought a house on the Front Range and adopted several animals.  I work for a fairly large company
      in the area as a full stack developer, while Lacey works at one of the best children's museums in the country.

      My hobbies include Dungeons and Dragons and other RPGs; as well as sketching, hiking, programming,
      and computer games. Recently I started to mess around with a
      <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> kit I bought awhile back in
      hopes of doing something cool with it.  More to come on that front...
