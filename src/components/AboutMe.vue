      Originally from Minneapolis I moved to sunny Colorado around nine years ago with my wife Lacey. Here
      we bought a house on the Front Range and adopted several animals.  I work for a fairly large company
      in the area as a full stack web developer, while Lacey works at one of the best children's museums in the country.

      My hobbies include Tabletop games, as well as sketching, hiking, programming, and computer games.
