      Originally from Minneapolis I moved to sunny Colorado around nine years ago with my wife Lacey where
      we bought a house on the Front Range and adopted several animals.  I work for a fairly large company
      in the area as a full stack developer, while Lacey works at one of the best children's museums in the country.

      My hobbies include Tabletop RPGs; as well as sketching, hiking, programming, and computer games.
      Recently I started to mess around with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>
      kit I bought awhile back in hopes of doing something cool with it.  More to come on that front...
