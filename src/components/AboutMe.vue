    <p>
      I'm originally from Minneapolis, and moved to sunny Colorado around nine years ago with my wife Lacey. Here
      we bought a house on the Front Range and adopted several animals.  I work for a fairly large company
      in as a full stack web developer, while Lacey works for a children's museum helping to enrich the minds
      of future generations.

      My hobbies include tabletop games, sketching, hiking, programming, computer games, and of course
      entertaining my dogs.
